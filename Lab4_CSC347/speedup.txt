After attempting a variety of curve fits, it seems that my graph of speed up is linear. Since Amdhal’s law assumes that the speed up will plateau, even with an increasing number of processors, my graph does not follow Amdahl’s law. Furthermore, Gufstafson’s law states that the relationship between the speedup and number of processors is linear, thus my graph follows Gufstafson’s Law.
